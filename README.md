# retroarch-playlist-maker
I made this script to build playlist for this emulator(ogxbox retroarch), just drag and drop the folder with the roms intro the script.
it supports subdirectories, you can drop the complete rom folder from resurrection xtras and will build the playlist
the script will also setup the playlist to the selected core or set it to auto

I improved the script, now has the option to add full titles to finalburn playlist (needs arcade.txt file in _arcade folder). i also included this:
- full finalburn datafile
- only parents datafile
- script to extract neogeo,cps1,cps2

after making the playlist the \n character needs to be removed, this can be done with notepad++ in extended mode,
or the script will do it automatically if xidel.exe is found next to the batch script: https://www.videlibri.de/xidel.html
