# retroarch-plalist-maker
I made this script to build playlist for this emulator(ogxbox retroarch), just drag and drop the folder with the roms intro the script.
it supports subdirectories, you can drop the complete rom folder from resurrection xtras and will build the playlist
the script will also setup the playlist to the selected core or set it to auto

to add box art or snaps, just place the pictures in the thumbnails folder:
thumbnails\{playlist name}\Named_Snaps

after making the playlist the \n character needs to be removed, this can be done with notepad++ in extended mode,
or the script will do it automatically if xidel.exe is found next to the batch script: https://www.videlibri.de/xidel.html
